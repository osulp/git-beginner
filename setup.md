# Create a personal access token for authentication

In order to authenticate yourself to Github on the command line, you need to
create a personal access token. GitHub uses personal access tokens for authentication
on the command line instead of your Github account password. Personal access tokens
work like passwords, but you can generate multiple access tokens for a single account.
This has some advantages, you can e.g.

*   Revoke a token when it is not needed anymore

*   Restrict the access scopes of a token e.g. to generate a token that can only be used
    to push to a repository, but not to change your personal settings.

A personal access token can be generated by navigating to your personal settings
in the GitHub web interface:

At the bottom left of your account settings, you find the developer settings section:

![Developer Settings on GitHub](fig/github-dev-settings.png)

Click on the Personal access tokens tab will allow you to generate a new token:

![Generate Personal Access Token on GitHub](fig/github-generate-token.png)

You can now configure which operations are possible with the new personal access
token that we are about to generate. For this course, we only need access to
public repositories:

Scrolling down and clicking on "Generate Token" will finalize the generation process.
Your token will be displayed on the screen. You need to copy and store this token now
just like you normally store passwords. Note that GitHub will never again display this
token to you. If you lose it, you have to revoke it and create a new one.

You will need to use this personal access token when GitHub asks for your username and password from the command line. 

# Start in the Desktop folder

We'll do our work in the `Desktop` folder so make sure you change your working directory to it with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop
~~~
{: .language-bash}
